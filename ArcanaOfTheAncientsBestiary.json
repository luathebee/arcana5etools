An accelerator fears “death” (perhaps “dissolution” is a better term) and concocts elaborate plans to develop better protections for itself. Ironically, sometimes this puts it in danger as it tries to take control of a defensible fortress or obtain a device that will grant it a powerful defense. A fully upright accelerator stands 15 feet high. Paranoia. Accelerators aren’t evil, but their interest in putting their own existence ahead of others means they might act in ways that people consider villainous.

									"The astraphin monolith’s crystalline eye is prized because it can be used as a weapon or a power source for a depleted relic. If used as a weapon, it fires a blast of force at one creature within 200 feet. On a failed DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, the target takes 5d8 force damage. The eye has a depletion of 1–3 in 1d100 when used this way.",
									"A character can attach the eye to a depleted relic by spending one hour and making a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If successful, the relic functions again and has a depletion of 1 in 1d6; failure means the character makes a depletion roll for the eye (1 in 1d6, checked each attempt). Once connected to a relic, if the relic depletes again, so does the monolith eye."
