							"An accelerator is an artificial intelligence encased in a metal shell with numerous limbs, sensory devices, and other accoutrements that allow it to interact with and understand the world around itself. An accelerator fears “death” (perhaps “dissolution” is a better term) and concocts elaborate plans to develop better protections for itself. Ironically, sometimes this puts it in danger as it tries to take control of a defensible fortress or obtain a device that will grant it a powerful defense. A fully upright accelerator stands 15 feet high. Paranoia. Accelerators aren’t evil, but their interest in putting their own existence ahead of others means they might act in ways that people consider villainous. If seriously threatened, an accelerator always chooses flight over fight.",
