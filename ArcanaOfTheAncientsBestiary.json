An accelerator fears “death” (perhaps “dissolution” is a better term) and concocts elaborate plans to develop better protections for itself. Ironically, sometimes this puts it in danger as it tries to take control of a defensible fortress or obtain a device that will grant it a powerful defense. A fully upright accelerator stands 15 feet high. Paranoia. Accelerators aren’t evil, but their interest in putting their own existence ahead of others means they might act in ways that people consider villainous.
