An accelerator fears “death” (perhaps “dissolution” is a better term) and concocts elaborate plans to develop better protections for itself. Ironically, sometimes this puts it in danger as it tries to take control of a defensible fortress or obtain a device that will grant it a powerful defense. A fully upright accelerator stands 15 feet high. Paranoia. Accelerators aren’t evil, but their interest in putting their own existence ahead of others means they might act in ways that people consider villainous.

They live to hunt and kill, but despite their savage nature, they are craftier and more intelligent than most savage humanoids. They {@footnote understand the numenera||Optional Rule: Intelligence (Ancients Arcana), page 259} and despise it. Even more than killing, they enjoy destroying devices of the ancient past. (Perhaps it is racial resentment for {@footnote wrongs done to them long ago|Chirogs might be mutant offshoots of what are now kobolds, lizardfolk, or even dragonkin.}.) Chirogs are hateful and angry, but not impossible to reason with. They speak their own simple language, and about one in three can speak or understand another language (typically Common or one used nearby). Chirogs do not use weapons or tools.",
