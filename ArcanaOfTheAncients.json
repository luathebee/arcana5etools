Just a few strands of spider web stretched across the walkway. That’s all, right? Except touching it with my dagger cut into the blade a half inch. A good iron blade, ruined! That’s how sharp and strong those things are. I turned around to tell Naeris, but then he says, ‘It’s shaking!’ I turned back to see a spider glistening like silver in our light. It was the size of a dinner platter, moving along two of them thin little strands right toward us! Good thing we had that heat-cutter that Julran found. We used it like a weapon on the spider as it approached. One blast with that drove it off, and we got outta there. Naeris said that as we left, he saw more of ’em. A whole network of their webs strung everywhere. I don’t want to go back there anytime soon."

These stat blocks can be used to represent almost any kind of uninteresting automaton-servant units that prepare or serve food, crafting units that build basic structures out of stone or wood, scouts that patrol an area, guardians that protect a creature or location, and so on. The GM can customize them by adjusting size, stats, specifying what form its attacks take (claws, slams, and so on), adding manufactured weapons (swords, rays, or even cyphers or relics), different movement modes, skill bonuses, or even a special ability. These changes should be limited so the GM doesn’t have to adjust the automaton’s challenge rating. For example, the basic automaton’s listed melee attack method is just called \"melee attack\"; it doesn’t matter if that’s a claw, drill, or blade, and the GM can use the listed attack stats for whatever weapon they decide the automaton is using. Depending on the automaton’s role, it may not have more than one attack type (a chef automaton might attack with a built-in chopping knife but not have any way to make ranged attacks). The following creature stat listings cover the five most common types of basic automatons.",

The images are representative of the danger and do not accurately depict what will happen. For example, an ambush by hostile bandits might trigger a warning image of amorphous creatures making aggressive motions, and dangerous weather might prompt an image of lightning bolts coming from a cloud. The GM decides when and how the staff warns you of danger (it might be hours or days in advance, depending on circumstances). For inexplicable reasons, sometimes the staff fails to deliver any warning at all (thus, it's all right if the GM forgets occasionally). In times of frequent danger (such as within a dungeon or in a war campaign), the images might become so frequent and overlapping that it becomes hard to predict when the threats might occur.",
